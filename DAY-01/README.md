# Day 01 – DSA Fundamentals & Programming Basics

## What I Studied Today

### 1. What is DSA?
**DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** is the study of how to **think, structure, and solve problems efficiently**.

- DSA is **language-agnostic**
- Programming language is just a **tool**
- Writing code is the **last step**, not the first

The real skill lies in **how you approach a problem**, not how fast you type syntax.

### 2. Problem Solving Mindset (Core DSA Flow)

Every problem should be approached in this order:

1. **Approach** – Understand the problem and decide how to think about it  
2. **Solution** – Convert the approach into logical steps  
3. **Time Complexity** – How fast the solution runs  
4. **Space Complexity** – How much memory it uses  

Skipping the approach phase leads to weak solutions and poor scalability.

### 3. What is Programming?
Programming means:

> Writing a set of instructions (code) that takes some input  
> and produces a meaningful output.

Good programs are:
- Predictable
- Readable
- Easy to reason about

---

### 4. Data Types
Basic data types introduced today:

- **String** → `"Hello"`
- **Number** → `10`, `3.14`
- **Boolean** → `true`, `false`

These are the building blocks of all programs.

### 5. Variables
Variables are used to store data.

#### `const`
- Value **cannot be reassigned**
- Preferred by default
- Helps avoid accidental bugs

```js
const name = "Rano";

let
Value can be reassigned
Use only when change is required

let age = 20;
age = 21;

Rule:
Use const by default.
Use let only when reassignment is necessary.

6. Important Concept: String + Number

When you add a string and a number:

"10" + 5

JavaScript converts the number into a string, and the result becomes:

"105"

This behavior is critical to understand to avoid logical bugs.

Key Takeaways (Day 01)

DSA is about thinking, not coding

Approach matters more than syntax

Code comes after clarity

Strong fundamentals prevent weak solutions later

📌 Day 01 completed: Foundations set.

### Final advice (read carefully)
If you write README files like this **every day**, you’ll:
- Actually remember what you studied
- Build a strong public learning trail
- Stand out from 90% of beginners who just dump code

Next step:  
👉 Create `Day-02/README.md` **before** writing code.  
If you can explain it clearly in English, coding it will be easy.
